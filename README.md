# emailSenderGUI

This project is to **create GUI interface with tkinter for user to send email to predefined email address** where **user** have to put in **their email address** but in fact the email that use to send the email is **not** user's email but actually was sent by the *predefined* email address or **the receiving** email which mean user **don't have to** use their password and **don't have to give permission** to access their email. 

**The header of the email will be in the format.**

  {user's email address} - Subject: {subject}\n\n{email's body} 
  
  **for example**

I'm still new to this but trying to challenge myself so it may not be perfect.  

**PS. in login use have to put in receiving email address and password in my case would be my email.**
